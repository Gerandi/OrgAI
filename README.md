# OrgAI Platform: Predictive Analytics for Organizational Behavior 

OrgAI is a comprehensive research platform for analyzing, modeling, and simulating organizational behavior based on organizational structure, communication patterns, and performance data. 

![OrgAI Platform](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x630?text=OrgAI+Platform) 

## Overview 

This platform combines advanced machine learning techniques with organizational behavior theories to provide researchers with tools for: 

1. **Data Processing**: Import and transform organizational data from various sources 
2. **Network Analysis**: Analyze communication patterns and organizational structure 
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and validate models for performance prediction 
4. **Organizational Simulation**: Run what-if scenarios and interventions 
5. **Research Collaboration**: Share models, datasets, and findings with other researchers 

## Getting Started 

### Backend Setup 

1. Navigate to the backend directory: 
``` 
cd backend 
``` 

2. Create a virtual environment: 
``` 
python -m venv venv 
``` 

3. Activate the virtual environment: 
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate` 
- Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate` 

4. Install dependencies: 
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

5. Run the development server: 
``` 
python main.py 
``` 

### Frontend Setup 

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: 
``` 
cd frontend 
``` 

2. Install dependencies: 
``` 
npm install 
``` 

3. Start the development server: 
``` 
npm start 
``` 

## User Guide 

### Data Import 

Upload organizational data to the platform in the following formats: 

1. **Organization Structure**: Employee data with reporting relationships 
2. **Communication Data**: Interaction records between employees 
3. **Performance Metrics**: Team and individual performance measurements 

The platform supports CSV and Excel files and provides templates for proper formatting. 

### Network Analysis 

The network analysis tools allow researchers to: 

- Visualize communication networks 
- Identify key influencers in the organization 
- Detect communities and silos 
- Measure information flow efficiency 

### Predictive Modeling 

Build models to predict: 

- Team performance based on structure and communication 
- Innovation potential 
- Employee satisfaction 
- Turnover risk 

The platform provides an intuitive model building interface with feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. 

### Organizational Simulation 

Run simulations to test: 

- Impact of organizational changes 
- Intervention effectiveness 
- Performance under different scenarios 
- Communication pattern evolution 

The simulation engine allows researchers to create and compare different organizational scenarios.
