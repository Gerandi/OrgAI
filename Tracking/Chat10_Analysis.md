# Chat 10 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Troubleshoot frontend-backend communication issues, specifically the "Failed to fetch project details" error. Implement default project creation for new users, ensure user-specific project access, add project deletion functionality, and replace placeholder activity data with real data.

**Initial Problem:** Frontend unable to communicate with the backend, specifically failing to fetch research project details. CORS errors and 500 Internal Server Errors were observed. Database schema mismatch (missing `dataset_type` column) was identified.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Code Implementation):**

1.  **Troubleshooting & Initial Fixes:**
    *   Analyzed frontend (`api.js`, `auth.js`, `Login.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `ResearchProjects.js`, `ProjectDetail.js`) and backend (`main.py`, `api.py`, `router.py`, `auth.py`, `users.py`, `research.py`, `database.py`, `settings.py`, `init_db.py`) files.
    *   Corrected frontend authentication calls in `auth.js` (login content-type, register request format).
    *   Hardcoded API URL in `api.js` for development stability.
    *   Fixed backend registration endpoint (`auth.py`) to accept JSON body using Pydantic model.
    *   Attempted to update `Dashboard.js` to fetch real data (though it still primarily uses mock data).
2.  **Fixing Project Detail Fetch Error:**
    *   Identified missing `updateProject` function in `ProjectContext.js` needed by `ProjectDetail.js`.
    *   Added `updateProject` function to `ProjectContext.js` and exposed it in the provider value.
    *   Created missing research-related components (`CreateProjectModal.js`, `DatasetList.js`, `ModelList.js`, `UploadDatasetModal.js`, `AddMemberModal.js`, `CreateModelModal.js`, `PublicationList.js`, `AddPublicationModal.js`, `ProjectSettingsModal.js`).
3.  **Resolving CORS and 500 Errors:**
    *   Corrected backend CORS configuration in `api.py` and `settings.py` to specifically allow the frontend origin (`http://localhost:3000`).
    *   Fixed the `GET /research/projects/{project_id}` endpoint in `research.py` by adding proper error handling (try/except block) and ensuring project existence is checked before permission checks.
4.  **Database Schema Fix:**
    *   Identified `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: datasets.dataset_type`.
    *   Provided instructions to reinitialize the database (`del orgai.db`, `python init_db.py`).
    *   Acknowledged and explained the non-critical `bcrypt` warning during initialization.
5.  **Default Project & Access Control:**
    *   Modified `auth.py` registration endpoint to create a default "My First Project" for new users.
    *   Modified `auth.py` login endpoint to check if a user has projects upon login and create a default one if not.
    *   Updated `research.py` `list_projects` endpoint to correctly join `ResearchProject` and `UserProject` tables and filter by `current_user.id`, ensuring users only see projects they are members of. Added error handling.
6.  **Project Deletion & Real Activity Data:**
    *   Added delete functionality (button, confirmation, API call) to `ProjectSettingsModal.js`.
    *   Created backend endpoint `activities.py` with `GET /activities/project/{project_id}` to fetch various project activities (dataset uploads, model creation, publication additions, team member additions).
    *   Updated API router (`router.py`) to include the new activities endpoint.
    *   Updated `ProjectActivity.js` component to fetch data from the new backend endpoint and display real activities instead of mock data.
7.  **Filename Preservation (Follow-up):**
    *   Modified frontend `DataImport.js` (`handleUpload` function) to send the original filename (without extension) as the `name` parameter.
    *   Modified backend `datasets.py` (`upload_dataset` function) to:
        *   Use the provided `name` (original filename) for the database record.
        *   Construct a unique `storage_filename` for the physical file, incorporating the original name, project ID (if any), user ID, and extension.
    *   Modified backend `datasets.py` (`process_dataset` function) to name the processed dataset based on the original dataset's name (e.g., "Original Name (Processed)").

**Status:** Frontend-backend communication issues resolved. Database schema corrected. Default project creation and user-specific project access implemented. Project deletion functionality added. Project activity display now uses real data fetched from the backend. Filename preservation during upload and processing is implemented.
