# Chat 6 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Review the overall application workflow (Data Upload → Processing → Network Analysis → Modeling) and implement the Simulation functionality based on Chat 6.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Debugging):**

1.  **Reviewed Workflow:** Analyzed the sequence of operations from data import to predictive modeling, identifying potential points of friction or missing connections between steps.
2.  **Identified Cohesion Issues:**
    *   Lack of explicit dataset type tracking from upload through processing.
    *   Network analysis component didn't automatically select the most relevant (processed) dataset.
    *   No direct link from network analysis insights to model building.
    *   Model builder used static feature lists instead of dynamic ones from the selected dataset.
    *   Insufficient validation for network features before visualization/modeling.
3.  **Implemented Workflow Fixes:**
    *   Added `type` field to `Dataset` model and updated upload/processing endpoints to use it.
    *   Enhanced `NetworkAnalysis.js` to prioritize loading 'processed' datasets.
    *   Added a "Create Model" button to `NetworkAnalysis.js` to pass context (dataset ID, suggested features) to `ModelBuilder.js`.
    *   Modified `ModelBuilder.js` to use the `/analyze-dataset` endpoint to dynamically populate available features.
    *   Added checks in `NetworkAnalysis.js` to verify if a dataset contains network features before attempting visualization.
    *   Improved the data passed from `DataImport.js` processing step to `ModelBuilder.js` suggestion.
4.  **Implemented Simulation Engine:** Created `backend/app/simulation/engine.py` with a basic `SimulationEngine` class capable of:
    *   Initializing from a DataFrame state.
    *   Running step-by-step updates (placeholder logic).
    *   Applying interventions (placeholder logic).
    *   Optionally using a predictive model (`OrganizationalPerformancePredictor`).
    *   Storing history and calculating summary results.
    *   Exporting results.
5.  **Implemented Simulation API:** Created `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/simulations.py` with endpoints:
    *   `POST /run`: To start a new simulation based on a configuration (initial dataset, model, steps, etc.). Handles dataset/model loading, access checks, engine execution, and saving results/metadata.
    *   `GET /`: To list accessible simulations.
    *   `GET /{simulation_id}`: To retrieve details and summary results of a specific simulation.
    *   `GET /{simulation_id}/results/{step}`: To download the state CSV for a specific simulation step.
6.  **Implemented Simulation Frontend:** Created `frontend/src/pages/SimulationPage.js` with UI elements for:
    *   Selecting initial dataset and optional predictive model.
    *   Configuring simulation parameters (steps, name, description).
    *   Running the simulation via the API.
    *   Displaying simulation history list.
    *   Viewing summary results of a selected simulation.
    *   Downloading step results.
7.  **Verified Model & Router:** Confirmed the `Simulation` model exists in `research.py` and the `simulations` router is included in `router.py`.

**Status:** Completed implementation of the core Simulation functionality, including backend engine, API, and frontend UI. Addressed workflow cohesion issues identified earlier, particularly linking data processing outputs to network analysis and model building inputs.
