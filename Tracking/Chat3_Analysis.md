# Chat 3 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Implement and debug Data Import and Project Management functionality based on Chat 3.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Debugging):**

1.  **Analyzed Data Import:** Reviewed frontend (`DataImport.js`, `api.js`) and backend (`datasets.py`, `processor.py`, templates) code related to data import.
2.  **Enhanced Backend Processing:** Updated `/datasets/{dataset_id}/process` endpoint in `datasets.py` to handle multiple dataset types (org, comm, perf) and merge them correctly.
3.  **Improved Data Processor:** Modified `processor.py` to handle data type conversions during merge, prevent duplicate columns, fill missing values, and calculate additional organizational metrics (`team_size`, `direct_reports_count`, `management_level`).
4.  **Created Template Files:** Ensured necessary CSV template files exist in `backend/app/data/templates/`.
5.  **Refined Frontend Data Import:** Updated `DataImport.js` to allow selection of multiple datasets (org, comm, perf) for processing and pass relevant IDs to the backend. Added UI elements to show selected datasets.
6.  **Debugged Dataset Listing:** Identified and fixed a bug in the backend `/datasets` endpoint (`datasets.py`) related to filtering by `project_id` and querying the `UserProject` association, ensuring users see personal datasets and datasets from projects they have access to. Corrected SQLAlchemy queries using model classes instead of strings.
7.  **Fixed Frontend Dataset Fetching:** Added console logs and a slight delay in `DataImport.js`'s `fetchDatasets` function after upload to improve debugging and ensure data consistency.
8.  **Implemented Project Context:**
    *   Created `frontend/src/contexts/ProjectContext.js` to manage active project state globally.
    *   Integrated `ProjectProvider` into `frontend/src/index.js` and `frontend/src/App.js`.
9.  **Implemented Project Selector:** Added a project selection dropdown to `frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.js`, allowing users to switch active projects or select "No Project". Added a refresh button.
10. **Integrated Project Context with Data Import:** Modified `DataImport.js` to use `activeProject` context to filter displayed datasets and associate uploaded datasets with the selected project.
11. **Implemented Project Detail Tabs:**
    *   Created components: `AddMemberModal`, `DatasetList`, `UploadDatasetModal`, `ModelList`, `CreateModelModal`, `PublicationList`, `AddPublicationModal`, `ProjectSettingsModal`, `ProjectActivity`.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.js` to include tabs for Overview, Team, Datasets, Models, and Publications, integrating the corresponding list and modal components.
12. **Implemented Project Settings & Deletion:**
    *   Created `ProjectSettingsModal.js` for updating project details.
    *   Added a delete project button with confirmation to the settings modal.
    *   Implemented a `DELETE /research/projects/{project_id}` endpoint in `research.py` to handle project deletion, including cascading deletes for associated resources (datasets, models, etc.) and permission checks.
13. **Fixed Project Detail Fetching:** Corrected resource counting logic in the `GET /research/projects/{project_id}` endpoint (`research.py`) by using proper model imports and adding error handling.

**Status:** Completed implementation and debugging of Data Import and Project Management features based on Chat 3. Project context is established, data import is project-aware, and the project detail page includes functional tabs for managing project resources.
