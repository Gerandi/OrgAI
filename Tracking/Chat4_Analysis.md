# Chat 4 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Debug project dropdown functionality, implement project settings (including delete), and ensure correct project/user associations for data management based on Chat 4.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Debugging):**

1.  **Diagnosed Project Dropdown Issue:** Identified that the dropdown in `MainLayout.js` wasn't correctly reflecting the selected project state managed by `ProjectContext.js`.
2.  **Diagnosed Project Details Fetch Error:** Found a 401 Unauthorized error when fetching project details, indicating an authentication token issue or incorrect API call setup.
3.  **Reviewed Auth Flow:** Examined `api.js` and `auth.js` to confirm token handling via localStorage and Authorization headers.
4.  **Reviewed Project Context:** Analyzed `ProjectContext.js` to understand how `activeProject` state and `selectProject` function were implemented. Found issues in how `selectProject` updated the state.
5.  **Reviewed Project Endpoints:** Checked `research.py` for project listing (`/projects`) and detail (`/projects/{project_id}`) endpoints, verifying user access checks. Found issues with resource counting using string table names instead of model classes.
6.  **Fixed Project Context:**
    *   Corrected the `selectProject` function in `ProjectContext.js` to properly fetch details and update `activeProject` state.
    *   Added checks for authentication token in `fetchProjects`.
    *   Added `updateProject` and `removeProject` functions to context for better state management after updates/deletions.
    *   Added more console logging for debugging.
7.  **Implemented Project Settings & Delete:**
    *   Created `ProjectSettingsModal.js` component with forms for updating title, description, status, visibility.
    *   Added a delete section with a two-step confirmation process.
    *   Implemented the `PUT /research/projects/{project_id}` endpoint in `research.py` for updating project details.
    *   Implemented the `DELETE /research/projects/{project_id}` endpoint in `research.py`, ensuring cascading deletion of related resources (Datasets, Models, Simulations, Publications, Citations, UserProject associations) and proper permission checks (owner only). Added error handling and rollback.
    *   Integrated `ProjectSettingsModal` into `ProjectDetail.js`.
    *   Updated `ProjectSettingsModal`'s delete handler to call the context's `removeProject` function (later reverted to direct API call for better error isolation).
8.  **Refined Frontend Components:**
    *   Updated `MainLayout.js` to use the corrected `selectProject` function and added a refresh button for the project list. Added checks for empty project list.
    *   Updated `ProjectDetail.js` to use the `updateProject` function from context when settings are saved.
    *   Updated `DatasetList.js` to include enhanced delete confirmation, batch delete functionality (UI elements added, backend logic assumed for now), and better loading/error states.
    *   Updated `UploadDatasetModal.js` with template download links and upload progress indication.
    *   Updated `DataImport.js` to use `useCallback` for `fetchDatasets` and reset selections when the active project changes. Improved dataset naming on upload. Added delete button to the dataset list within this page.
    *   Created `ProjectActivity.js` component (with mock data) and integrated it into the `ProjectDetail.js` overview tab.
9.  **Corrected Backend Queries:** Fixed queries in `research.py` (resource counting, citation deletion) to use SQLAlchemy model classes (`Dataset`, `Model`, etc.) instead of potentially incorrect string table names.
10. **Ensured Directory Structure:** Created `model_storage` and subdirectories (`datasets`, `processed`) and `backend/app/data/templates` if they didn't exist.
11. **Created Template Files:** Wrote sample CSV templates (`organization_structure_template.csv`, `communication_data_template.csv`, `performance_metrics_template.csv`) to the templates directory.
12. **Fixed React Hook Rule Violation:** Corrected the placement of `useEffect` in `UploadDatasetModal.js` to adhere to the Rules of Hooks.

**Status:** Completed debugging and implementation for project management features (settings, delete) and refined data import/management associations with projects and users based on Chat 4. Project dropdown and details page should now function correctly. Data upload is project-aware.
