# Chat 8 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Fix API connection issues reported by the user, specifically the "Network Error" on various pages and failure to fetch project details. Implement the Dashboard page with visualizations.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Debugging):**

1.  **Fixed `MODEL_STORAGE_PATH`:** Corrected the path in `backend/app/config/settings.py` to use an absolute path, resolving potential file access issues from different application parts. (Replicated from chat history)
2.  **Added Debugging Logs:** Inserted `print` statements in backend API endpoints (`research.py`, `datasets.py`, `models.py`, `auth.py`, `main.py`) and frontend services (`api.js`, `auth.js`) to trace requests and identify failures. (Replicated from chat history)
3.  **Increased API Timeout:** Extended the frontend API request timeout in `frontend/src/services/api.js` from 10s to 30s (though this change might have been reverted later, the intent was captured in the chat). (Replicated from chat history)
4.  **Created Dashboard Components:** Created the following React components in `frontend/src/components/dashboard/`:
    *   `OrgOverview.js`: Displays key organizational stats (employees, departments, team size).
    *   `PerformanceChart.js`: Displays performance trends using Recharts LineChart.
    *   `TeamPerformanceBar.js`: Displays team performance comparison using Recharts BarChart.
    *   `NetworkMetrics.js`: Displays key network health indicators.
    *   `RecentActivity.js`: Displays a list of recent actions.
5.  **Implemented Dashboard Page:** Created `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js`:
    *   Imports the newly created dashboard components.
    *   Uses `useEffect` to fetch data from hypothetical `/dashboard/*` endpoints when the component mounts or `activeProject` changes.
    *   Uses `Promise.all` to fetch data concurrently.
    *   Includes basic loading and error handling states.
    *   Renders the dashboard components, passing the fetched data as props.

**Status:** Addressed the reported `MODEL_STORAGE_PATH` issue. Added extensive debugging logs as requested in the chat history. Implemented the structure and components for the Dashboard page based on the chat description, including data fetching logic (assuming backend endpoints `/dashboard/*` exist as implied by the frontend implementation). The API connection issues mentioned by the user in the chat were addressed by adding logs and attempting configuration changes, but the root cause wasn't definitively fixed within this chat's scope, as per user instruction to focus on implementation.
