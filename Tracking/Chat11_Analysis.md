# Chat 11 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Implement the Model Builder page, allowing users to select processed datasets, configure machine learning models, train them, view results (including metrics and feature importance), and save the trained models. Ensure integration with the data import/processing workflow.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Code Implementation):**

1.  **Frontend Implementation (`ModelBuilder.js`):**
    *   Recreated the page structure.
    *   Implemented logic to fetch *processed* datasets suitable for modeling.
    *   Added state management for dataset selection, model configuration (type, features, target, hyperparameters), and training results.
    *   Integrated logic to receive `datasetId`, `suggestedFeatures`, and `preSelectTarget` from navigation state (e.g., coming from Data Import).
    *   Implemented fetching of dataset schema/columns using the new backend endpoint (`/models/datasets/{dataset_id}/schema`).
    *   Created UI for selecting target variable and features, grouped by category (Network, Organizational, Performance, Other).
    *   Added logic to automatically suggest features and target based on dataset schema and location state.
    *   Integrated `ModelTrainingForm.js` and `ModelResultsPanel.js` components.
    *   Implemented `trainModel` function to call the backend `/models/train` endpoint.
    *   Implemented `saveModel` function to call the backend `/models/{model_id}` update endpoint (or a dedicated save endpoint if created) after successful training.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation/Update:**
    *   Recreated `ModelTrainingForm.js`: Handles UI for selecting model type, setting test size, configuring hyperparameters specific to the selected model type, and triggering train/save actions.
    *   Recreated `ModelResultsPanel.js`: Displays key metrics (Accuracy/R², Training Time), feature importance chart, detailed performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1), and potential model insights based on the backend response. Handles loading and error states.
3.  **Backend Implementation (`models.py`):**
    *   Added `GET /datasets/{dataset_id}/schema` endpoint to provide column names and inferred types (numeric, categorical, etc.) for a given dataset.
    *   Enhanced `POST /models/train` endpoint:
        *   Added robust validation for input configuration (dataset ID, features, target).
        *   Implemented data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling numeric features, one-hot encoding categorical features) using scikit-learn Pipelines and ColumnTransformer.
        *   Added logic to automatically determine if the task is classification or regression based on the target variable's characteristics.
        *   Adjusted the requested `model_type` to a suitable classification or regression algorithm if the user's choice doesn't match the task type.
        *   Supported multiple model types: Random Forest (Classifier/Regressor), Gradient Boosting (Classifier/Regressor), Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM (SVC/SVR).
        *   Implemented default hyperparameter fetching and merging with user-provided ones.
        *   Performed train/test split.
        *   Trained the selected model using the pipeline.
        *   Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 for classification; MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² for regression).
        *   Extracted feature importance (for tree-based models).
        *   Saved the trained pipeline (including preprocessor and model) using pickle.
        *   Created a `Model` record in the database, storing metadata, hyperparameters, key metrics, and the path to the saved artifact.
        *   Returned a detailed response including the new model ID, metrics, feature importance, and training time.
    *   Added `PUT /models/{model_id}` endpoint to update model details (name, description, project association).
    *   Enhanced `GET /models` (list) and `GET /models/{model_id}` (details) endpoints to provide relevant model information.
    *   Added `DELETE /models/{model_id}` endpoint with permission checks.
    *   Included helper functions for model instantiation, default hyperparameters, and task type detection.

**Status:** Model Builder page implemented on both frontend and backend. Users can select processed datasets, configure various ML models, train them, view detailed results including feature importance, and save the trained models to their projects. The workflow is integrated with the data processing step.
