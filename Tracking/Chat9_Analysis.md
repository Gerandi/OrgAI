# Chat 9 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Implement user profile functionality, organization and team management views, and ensure integration between these features and the existing research project system. Address placeholders and ensure edit/delete buttons are functional.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Code Implementation):**

1.  **Backend Model Updates:**
    *   Added `organization_id` and `team_id` (nullable) ForeignKeys to `ResearchProject` model (`research.py`).
    *   Added `research_projects` relationships to `Organization` and `Team` models (`organization.py`).
2.  **Backend API Endpoint Updates:**
    *   Modified `POST /research/projects` to accept `organization_id` and `team_id` (`research.py`).
    *   Modified `GET /research/projects` to allow filtering by `organization_id` and `team_id` (`research.py`).
    *   Enhanced `GET /users/me` and `GET /users/{user_id}` to include the user's organizations (`users.py`).
    *   Added `GET /users/me/organizations` and `GET /users/me/teams` endpoints (`users.py`).
    *   Created `departments.py` with full CRUD endpoints (`/departments`, `/departments/{dept_id}`, `/departments/{dept_id}/employees`, `/departments/{dept_id}/teams`).
    *   Created `employees.py` with full CRUD endpoints (`/employees`, `/employees/{employee_id}`).
    *   Added endpoints for managing organization members (`GET /organizations/{org_id}/members`, `POST /organizations/{org_id}/members`, `DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/members/{user_id}`) in `organizations.py`.
    *   Added endpoints for managing team employees (`GET /teams/{team_id}/employees`, `POST /teams/{team_id}/employees`, `DELETE /teams/{team_id}/employees/{employee_id}`) in `teams.py`.
    *   Updated API router (`router.py`) to include `departments` and `employees` routers.
3.  **Frontend Page Creation:**
    *   Created `Profile.js`: Displays user info, organizations, and teams using tabs. Includes profile editing functionality.
    *   Created `OrganizationDetail.js`: Displays organization details, members, teams, departments, and associated projects using tabs. Includes editing and member management.
    *   Created `TeamDetail.js`: Displays team details, members, and performance metrics using tabs. Includes editing and member management.
    *   Created `DepartmentDetail.js`: Displays department details, teams, and employees using tabs. Includes editing.
    *   Created `OrganizationNew.js`: Form for creating a new organization.
    *   Created `TeamNew.js`: Form for creating a new team within an organization.
    *   Created `DepartmentNew.js`: Form for creating a new department within an organization.
4.  **Frontend Component Creation:**
    *   Created `OrganizationsList.js`: Reusable component to display a list of organizations.
    *   Created `TeamsList.js`: Reusable component to display a list of teams.
    *   Created `OrganizationProjectFilter.js`: Component to filter research projects by organization.
5.  **Frontend Service Creation:**
    *   Created `profile.js`: Centralized service for API calls related to profiles, organizations, teams, departments, and employees.
6.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Updated `App.js` to include routes for all new pages.
    *   Updated `MainLayout.js` to remove the 'Profile' link from the main navigation (kept in user menu).
    *   Updated `ProjectContext.js` to include `activeOrgId` state and filter projects based on it.
    *   Integrated `OrganizationProjectFilter` into `ResearchProjects.js`.
    *   Implemented edit/delete/add functionality and buttons in relevant detail pages.

**Status:** Implemented comprehensive user profile, organization, team, and department management features on both backend and frontend. Integrated these features with the existing research project system by linking projects to organizations/teams and updating context/filtering logic. Addressed previous placeholders and ensured core CRUD operations are available through the UI.
