# Chat 7 Analysis and Tracking

**Objective:** Diagnose and fix backend-frontend communication issues, particularly around dataset handling and type consistency. Implement a feature requiring project selection for key application pages based on Chat 7.

**Actions Taken (Simulated MCP Tool Usage & Debugging):**

1.  **Diagnosed Communication Issues:** Identified inconsistencies in how datasets were handled between backend and frontend:
    *   Missing dedicated backend endpoint for network analysis data.
    *   Frontend guessing dataset types instead of using backend-provided `dataset_type`.
    *   Frontend (`NetworkAnalysis.js`) performing data processing (CSV parsing, network building) that should happen on the backend.
    *   Insufficient information passed from backend processing/analysis endpoints to frontend.
2.  **Created Network API Endpoint:** Added `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/networks.py` with endpoints:
    *   `GET /{dataset_id}/metrics`: To calculate and return basic network stats.
    *   `GET /{dataset_id}/visualization`: To return nodes, links, metrics, and department lists needed for frontend visualization.
3.  **Updated API Router:** Modified `backend/app/api/v1/router.py` to include the new `/networks` router.
4.  **Enhanced Dataset Endpoints:**
    *   Modified `GET /datasets` in `datasets.py` to include `dataset_type` in the response list.
    *   Modified `POST /datasets/{id}/process` in `datasets.py` to return an enhanced summary including `feature_names`, `network_features`, `has_network_data`, and `potential_targets`.
    *   Modified `GET /models/analyze-dataset/{id}` in `models.py` to use `dataset_type`, identify network features, suggest targets based on type/content, and add feature categories.
5.  **Refactored Frontend Network Analysis:** Updated `frontend/src/pages/NetworkAnalysis.js` to:
    *   Call the new `/networks/{dataset_id}/visualization` endpoint instead of `/datasets/{id}/export`.
    *   Remove local CSV parsing and network data processing logic.
    *   Use data directly from the new API response for visualization and stats.
    *   Improved error handling for datasets unsuitable for network analysis.
6.  **Improved Frontend Data Import:** Updated `frontend/src/pages/DataImport.js` to:
    *   Correctly identify dataset types using the `dataset_type` field from the API response.
    *   Provide better context (processed dataset ID, features, target) when suggesting navigation to Network Analysis or Model Builder after processing.
7.  **Improved Frontend Model Builder:** Updated `frontend/src/pages/ModelBuilder.js` to:
    *   Filter available datasets based on `dataset_type === 'processed'`.
    *   Use the enhanced `/models/analyze-dataset` response to dynamically populate available features and suggest target variables.
8.  **Implemented Project Requirement:**
    *   Created `frontend/src/contexts/ProjectContext.js` to manage active project state globally.
    *   Created `frontend/src/hoc/withProjectRequired.js` HOC to restrict access to pages if no project is active.
    *   Created `frontend/src/components/ProjectSelection.js` component for selecting/creating projects.
    *   Wrapped `<App />` with `<ProjectProvider />` in `frontend/src/index.js`.
    *   Attempted to integrate `ProjectSelection` into `MainLayout.js` (failed due to tool errors, but HOC wrapping enforces the requirement).
    *   Wrapped `DataImport.js`, `ModelBuilder.js`, `NetworkAnalysis.js`, and `SimulationPage.js` exports with `withProjectRequired`.

**Status:** Addressed major backend-frontend communication issues related to datasets. Implemented a dedicated network analysis API. Enforced project selection for relevant pages using a context and HOC pattern. Encountered persistent tool errors modifying `MainLayout.js`, preventing full visual integration of the `ProjectSelection` component in the layout, but the functional requirement is enforced by the HOC.
